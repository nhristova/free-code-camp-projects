## Platform

You can build your project by using this CodePen template and clicking Save to create your own pen. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js

Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.

Note: Twitter does not allow links to be loaded in an iframe. Try using the target="_blank" or target="_top" attribute on the #tweet-quote element if your tweet won't load. target="_top" will replace the current tab so make sure your work is saved.
